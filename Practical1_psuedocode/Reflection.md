#Main Concepts.

#Input and Output in Python
Taking input from user using input().
Using print() to display results.
#Data Types and Type Conversion
The above example uses int() to convert a user input as a string into an integer.
#Arithmetic Operations
Multiplication for calculating area.
You can use modulus operator % to check whether number is even or odd.
Formula application for temperature conversion.
#Conditional Statements
Using if and else to for conditional decisions.

#New skills and knowledge acquired.

How to interact with user using input or output
How to use arthimetic in code (e.g., area = length × width, °F = 1.8 × °C + 32).
To find even or odd numbers we can use % operator.
How indentation matters in Python for code blocks.

#What I learned.

I learnt that in Python if we are inputting values then we need to 'typecast' it(string to int in this case)to perform any calculations.
I had learnt how to use decision-making (if-else) to solve problems where you have to check the condition.
I learned how to add formulas to code.
I found that small differences in syntax or misplaced spaces can prevent the program from running.

#The challenges I faced

I had some problems with the input() function, as it reads strings and I had to convert it to integer.
Syntax and indentation in if-else statements was confusing to remember.
It wasn't easy for me to grasp why exactly something like modulus %, while checking for odd or even numbers.
At few places, I had mistakes in writing down the formulae (missing bracket, wrong operator), I later verified and corrected them
