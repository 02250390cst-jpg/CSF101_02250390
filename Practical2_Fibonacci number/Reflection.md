Main Concepts.

What The Fibonacci Numbers Are, And How They Are Calculated.
Understanding two methods to solve a particular problem: recursion and iteration.
The concept of recursion involves the process of calling the same function repeatedly until a times comes when a specific condition is met.
Understanding loops and how to piece the solution together iteratively.

#New skills and knowledge acquired

Defining recursive functions with base cases.
Efficient problem-solving through recursive looping.
Document the code â€“Write clear and commented code to describe logic.
Receiving user input and passing it to function calls.

#What I learned.

Recursive solutions can be elegant, but they might be inefficient for large inputs due to repeated calculations. 
Iterative solutions are usually more efficient in terms of time and space.
Both have same result but the performance differs.
Base cases in recursion are significant to stop infinite calls.

Challenges faced:

Understanding how recursion works and visualizing the function calls.
Ensuring base cases are correctly implemented to avoid stack overflow.
Thinking about how to convert a naturally recursive problem into an iterative one.
Handling user input safely and validating input (e.g., non-negative integers).
